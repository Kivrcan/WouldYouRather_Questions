This is just a repo of some sample questions and instructions on how to import questions in the VRChat world: [Would You Rather](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_4a48a5c1-fae9-416c-98ad-ec410687224d)

# Importing in game
Paste into the textbox in the world either similar style to the json files in this repo or a simple text with options separated by " or " and each question on a new row

Basic Json sample
```
{
	"questions": [
		"live in the past or the future?", 
		"be able to control fire or water?", 
    ]
}
```

Basic text sample
```
live in the past or the future?
be able to control fire or water?
```

# TODO
* Make the " or " separator changeable for better support for other langages
